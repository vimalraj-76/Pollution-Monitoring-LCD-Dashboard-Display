# Pollution-Monitoring-LCD-Dashboard-Display
Our solution mainly focuses on acquiring the air quality indices of different major ports, monitored by a multiple sensor integrated controller. To extend the acquired AQI predictions and to display it in the dashboard located in the monitoring center as a time series data, the system is yet to be designed in such a way that it can display the AQIâ€™s of multiple major ports in the city and as well it detects the port in which the AQI is above the threshold pollution level. Without limiting it to this extent, our system can also predict the source of the pollution that caused the change in the AQI value by examining the real time pollutant and source datasets obtained from the Ports. Which enables the authorities to temporarily stop/postpone certain activities that causes the change in AQI value until things(AQI) get normal.
